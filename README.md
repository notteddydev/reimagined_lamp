### ToDo (AddressBook)

- Action to download vcard for contact
- Action to download all vcards on display in contact-list - maybe this will mean more stringent filtering
- Add more filtering to contact-list, such as Address.city, Address.neighbourhood, Address.country.verbose
- Add "add" buttons by each address, email, and phone numbers on contact-detail, and create views etc. and bin tertiary nav
- Add "archived" logic for addresses, emails, and phone numbers. Do not show these on vcard, and use strikethrough styling on them in detail views.
- Maybe more effort that it's worth, but attach vcard to email / sms / whatsapp message
- Add copy link to WalletAddress.address in contact-detail
- Add copy link to Address in address-detail and contact-detail
- Add type (home, work, etc.) to email, address, phonenumber and apply to vcard
- Ermm... maybe... like... add some tests
- Erm... add docblocks, pattern code, add typehints, refactor code - view classes particularly.
