### ToDo (AddressBook)

- Add "archived" logic for addresses, emails, and phone numbers. Do not show these on vcard, and use strikethrough styling on them in detail views.
- Maybe more effort that it's worth, but attach vcard to email / sms / whatsapp message
- Add copy link to WalletAddress.address in contact-detail
- Add copy link to Address in address-detail and contact-detail
- Add type (home, work, etc.) to email, address, phonenumber and apply to vcard
- Merge ContactListView and contact_list_download_view
- Add option to filter by multiple fields to ContactList
- Ermm... maybe... like... add some tests
- Erm... add docblocks, pattern code, add typehints, refactor code - view classes particularly.
- Create option to download a "lite" vcard, or customise what is downloaded.
